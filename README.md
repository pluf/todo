We all have those days when there are a million things to do, and we don't know how we're going
to get it all done. It's easy to become overwhelmed by the vast quantity of tasks that we must
do from day to day. Sometimes we have so many balls in the air, that we may even lose track of
some loose ends and forget to do important things. When we get too busy, we end up feeling
like we are barely able to keep our heads above water.

A module to handel jobs and issues.
